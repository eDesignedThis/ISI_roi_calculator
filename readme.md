Steps For Installation.

Requires Pug (developers will not need to adjust this)
Requires Bootstrap (linked in index.html)
Requires jquery, if not already installed.
Requires DevExtreme (for chart(s) visualization, linked in index.html)

To Run app:
1. Download project and open within IDE
2. Navigate to html > index.html, right-click and select 'Open with Live Server'.
3. Please be advised that you will need to make a copy of the index.html file named something else, or else Pug will override changes upon next compilation.
